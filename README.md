# Hearts of Iron 4 National Focus Maker
## A web-based tool to create national focus trees for your own mods in HOI4

This repo is to serve as a way for backups, improvements, and for people to be able to make pull requests when Paradox create new functions for modding.

This tool is not created by, or on behalf of, Paradox Interactive. The tool will be provided free of charge at [a website which currently WIP]. The tool does not modify game files, and any issues with the tool will not affect the main game.
